# 0007: Parity policy with adr-tools

Date: 2025-10-06
Status: Accepted

## Context

Users expect behavior similar to `adr-tools`.

## Decision

Provide structurally identical behavior and outputs where feasible. Wording may differ. `generate graph` is not implemented in v1.

## Consequences

* Smooth adoption and migration.
* Clear deviation log.

## Alternatives considered

* Diverge on behavior early.
