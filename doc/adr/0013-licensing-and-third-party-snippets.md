# 0013: Licensing and third-party snippets

Date: 2025-10-06
Status: Accepted

## Context

Parity tests may reuse small upstream text.

## Decision

License our code BSD-3-Clause.
Place CC-BY-4.0 snippets in `third_party/` and include a `NOTICE`.

## Consequences

* Clear obligations and attribution.

## Alternatives considered

* Avoid verbatim reuse (more work).
