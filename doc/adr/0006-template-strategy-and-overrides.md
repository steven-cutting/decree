# 0006: Template strategy and overrides

Date: 2025-10-06
Status: Accepted

## Context

We want our own wording while keeping structure.

## Decision

Ship a simple default template with the standard sections.
Allow overrides via `ADR_TEMPLATE` or `--template`.

## Consequences

* Clear licensing boundaries.
* Teams can customize.

## Alternatives considered

* Vendor upstream template as default.
